    <!--Three different adjectives that describe you positively-->
    <h3 style = "color: yellowgreen;">compassionate, diligent, ambitious</h3>
    <h2 style = "color: violet">My goals</h2>
    <p>My name is Rohan and I live in the United States, in Dublin, Calfornia. I was born in new Jersey, and have a great family. I am an ambitious mathlete, who is currently aiming to qualify for the International Mathematical Olympiad. I have been training for this ever since I was in the grade. Recently, however, I also picked up a passion for computer programming. I want to pursure majors for both applied mathematics and computer science. In addition to this, I want to be able to maintain a 4.0 GPA or above throughout my high school career. At the same time, I also want to pursue other hobbies and extracurriculars, maintaining a balanced life, with both academics and non-academics. I want to be able to enjoy the journey to starting a career with both applied mathematics and computer science. To do that, hard work is essential, but at the same time, I have to manage my stress, and do the things that I enjoy, enabling me to rememer that what I am trying to accomplish is also what I enjoy, and that I need to maintain that.

    <h2 style = "color:dodgerblue">My Accomplishments and Strengths</h2>
    <p>My best strengths, which can help with my career include my ambition and determination. I have a long way to go, before I can pursue a career, involving both applied mathematics and computer science, requiring me to consistently work hard, and improve upon my current skills. In the eighth grade, I managed to get a close to perfect score on the Math section of the SAT test, with a rank of 99 percentile, of all the test-takers. I was recognized by John Hopkins University, and received a position to tutor by the Collegeboard itself. As a freshman, I took that opportunity to tutor, and have helped juniors and seniors do well on the SAT math section. </p>

    <h2 style = "color:orangered">My abilities (experienced based)</h2>
    <p>An experience that I would like to share was me taking an extremely hard class for the first time (in the summer between 8th and 9th grade). I took the DPIE Biology class. Grades were 100% assessment based, and there were tests every single day. A lot of content was covered, along with a lot of assignments daily. I soon realized that I needed to work in that class, and spent countless hourse every day, for six weeks. This class has changed my work ethic, and made me more disciplined about due dates and also a much harder worker. I have become more serious about accomplishing goals that I have initially set.</p>
    <h2 style = "color:gold">My Thanks</h2>
    <p>Thank you so much for reading about my goals, accomplishments, and personality. This page was all about the traits and skills that make me unique as a person. I hope that this has also inspired you to find something unique about youself!<br> -Rohan Senapati</p>
